.SH NAME
uncov is a software development tool that collect and processes coverage
reports.
.PP
\f[B]NOTE:\f[R] since uncov\-gcov isn\[cq]t the only way to collect C
and C++ coverage for uncov anymore, it is deprecated.
However, it is still provided in case it might be useful in some
environments.
Using \[lq]uncov new\-gcovi\[rq] should work noticeably faster and
doesn\[cq]t require sources on adding build to the database.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]uncov\f[R] operates a number of entities, which are directly
linked to subcommands and information they output.
Below you can find their description.
.SS Repository
Repository is used as a source of file contents and its root directory
(not worktree one) is used to store data of \f[CR]uncov\f[R] itself.
While the relation by default is of one\-to\-one kind, same
\f[CR]uncov\f[R] data can be shared by multiple copies of the same
repository by linking or copying \f[CR]uncov.sqlite\f[R] file manually.
.PP
Repository that corresponds to current working directory is discovered
automatically and doesn\[cq]t need to be specified explicitly.
Otherwise \f[B]<repo\-path>\f[R] can point either to repository
directory (\f[CR].git\f[R]) or its main worktree (doesn\[cq]t seem to
work with secondary worktrees).
.SS Builds
The largest entity \f[CR]uncov\f[R] operates within repository is a
build.
A build has the following properties:
.IP \[bu] 2
number identifying the build (greater than \f[CR]0\f[R]);
.IP \[bu] 2
name of reference within repository (branch usually);
.IP \[bu] 2
commit object that corresponds to the build;
.IP \[bu] 2
date and time at which it was imported;
.IP \[bu] 2
finally, set of files with their coverage that constitute a build.
.SS Files
File is the second most important thing after a build.
It\[cq]s characterised by:
.IP \[bu] 2
path within repository;
.IP \[bu] 2
coverage information (basically an array specifying which lines are
covered);
.IP \[bu] 2
MD5 hash (to verify that \f[CR]uncov\f[R] state is consistent with
repository).
.SS Directories
As we have set of files with their paths, we can derive interesting part
of file\-system structure of repository (ignoring the rest of it, where
there are no source files).
Directory is just a sum of information of all files it contains.
.SS Build relation
In order to be able to calculate change of coverage an ordering of
builds is imposed, which currently simply assumes that for build number
\f[CR]N\f[R] there is a \f[I]previous build\f[R] with number
\f[CR]N \- 1\f[R] (when \f[CR]N > 0\f[R], build number \f[CR]0\f[R] has
no previous build).
.SS Statistics
File coverage information is the sole source of statistics.
Based on data provided any line of code is classified as either
\f[I]relevant\f[R] or \f[I]not relevant\f[R].
Relevant lines in turn can be \f[I]covered\f[R] or \f[I]missed\f[R].
So each source line must be in one of three states:
.IP \[bu] 2
not relevant;
.IP \[bu] 2
not covered (with number of hits being \f[CR]0\f[R]);
.IP \[bu] 2
covered (with number of hits being greater than \f[CR]0\f[R]).
.PP
Coverage rate is defined simply as number of covered lines divided by
number of relevant lines.
If file consists solely of not relevant lines (which is also the case
for files that don\[cq]t exist in one of builds being compared),
it\[cq]s assumed to have 100% coverage.
We also have number of lines covered, missed and total number of
relevant lines (sum of previous two) and can calculate their changes.
.PP
It is these statistics that are displayed by subcommands alongside
builds, directories and files.
Data describing changes is calculated from state of files in two builds:
some build and build that is considered to be its predecessor.
.SS Comparison
Comparison accounts for hierarchy: build comparison compares all their
files, directory comparison compares files under specified path, file
comparison compares only one file.
.PP
However, comparing coverage is not exactly the same as comparing files.
While we are interested in whether changed code is covered we don\[cq]t
really care about addition or removal of lines that aren\[cq]t relevant
for coverage.
So these uninteresting changes are not shown.
.PP
On the other hand, change of coverage when only number of line hits
increased or decreased is also irrelevant in most cases and are shown
only by separate command.
Regular comparison draws attention mainly to lines that have changed
their state (e.g., from \[lq]not covered\[rq] to \[lq]covered\[rq] or
vice versa).
Should such lines be part of diff context, they are displayed as
somewhat dimmed compared to lines with interesting changes.
.SS Notations
For the sake of brevity interface uses several intuitive abbreviations:
.IP \[bu] 2
Cov \[en] coverage;
.IP \[bu] 2
Ref \[en] reference (of VCS);
.IP \[bu] 2
C \[en] covered;
.IP \[bu] 2
M \[en] missed;
.IP \[bu] 2
R \[en] relevant.
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.SS Syntax of build numbers
Build numbers are specified in arguments for subcommands by being
prepended with \f[CR]\[at]\f[R] sign.
So to refer to build number \f[CR]5\f[R], one would write
\f[CR]\[at]5\f[R].
.PP
Build numbers start at \f[CR]1\f[R], this leaves \f[CR]\[at]0\f[R]
unused.
It is thus repurposed to be a handy shortcut for the latest build.
An alternative form of writing \f[CR]\[at]0\f[R] is
\f[CR]\[at]\[at]\f[R].
.PP
Build numbers can also be specified in the form of \f[CR]\[at]\-N\f[R],
in which case they select Nth to the latest build.
For example, to specify range from previous build to one build before
that one would write \f[CR]\[at]\-1 \[at]\-2\f[R].
.PP
Lastly, branch names can be used to specify latest build from that
branch (e.g., \f[CR]\[at]master\f[R]).
.SS Resolving ambiguity
Some commands can take optional build number, which opens the door for
ambiguity between file/directory names and build identifiers.
Anything that starts with \f[CR]\[at]\f[R] at a suitable position on
command\-line is assumed to be build number.
For files which have \f[CR]\[at]\f[R] as prefix, specifying build number
becomes mandatory.
As an example:
.IP
.EX
# this doesn\[aq]t work
uncov show \[at]strangely\-named\-file
# this is equivalent and works
uncov show \[at]\[at] \[at]strangely\-named\-file
.EE
.SS Default build
If a subcommand accepts build number, in almost all cases it\[cq]s an
optional parameter and latest build is used when this argument is
omitted.
.SS Subcommand aliases
Instead of requiring arguments for subcommands a different approach has
been taken.
Some commands have several names and depending on how you call them,
they act slightly differently.
.SS Paths
As a convenience when current working directory is under work tree of a
repository, paths that do not start with a slash \f[CR]/\f[R] are
automatically converted to be relative to root of the repository.

.PP
\f[B]Usage: help <subcommand>\f[R]

.SS missed
Same as \f[B]show\f[R] subcommand, but folds not relevant and covered
lines and thus displays only parts of files that lack coverage.
.PP
See description of \f[B]show\f[R] subcommand below for syntax.
.SS new
Imports new build from standard input.
.PP
\f[B]Usage: new\f[R]

<all other files in the same format>
.EE
.PP
Integers have the following meaning:
.IP \[bu] 2
when less than zero (specifically \f[CR]\-1\f[R]) \[en] line is not
relevant;
.IP \[bu] 2
when equal to zero \[en] line is not covered (missed);
.IP \[bu] 2
when greater than zero \[en] line is covered and was hit that many
times.
.SS new\-gcovi
Generates coverage via \f[CR]gcov\f[R] and imports it.
.PP
\f[B]Usage: new\-gcovi [options\&...]

\f[B]Parameters:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]covoutroot\f[R] \[en] where to look for generated coverage data.
.PP
\f[B]Options:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]\-h [ \-\-help ]\f[R] \[en] display help message;
.IP \[bu] 2

working directory is dirty.
.PP
To do its work this subcommand invokes \f[CR]gcov\f[R] and then parses
its output in intermediate format, which is only mostly stable so usage
with some versions of \f[CR]gcov\f[R] might require changes.
.SS new\-json
Imports new build in JSON format from standard input.
.PP
\f[B]Usage: new\-json\f[R]
.PP
Reads coverage information from standard input in the following format:
.IP

            \[dq]name\[dq]: \[dq]file name relative to repository root\[dq],
            \[dq]coverage\[dq]: [null for not relevant lines, int for number of hits]
        }
