NAME
====

uncov is a software development tool that collect and processes coverage
reports.

**NOTE:** since uncov-gcov isn't the only way to collect C and C++ coverage for
uncov anymore, it is deprecated.  However, it is still provided in case it might
be useful in some environments.  Using "uncov new-gcovi" should work noticeably
faster and doesn't require sources on adding build to the database.
